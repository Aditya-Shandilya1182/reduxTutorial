A repo that I used to learn redux.

Redux : A complex state management tool with a single store as CDS(Central Data Store).

Reducers : Manages the state and returns the newly updated state.

Actions : Actions have two property types : unique identifier and payload.

Dispatch : It is used to send actions to update the data.
